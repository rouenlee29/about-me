Often I find myself creating an algorithm and asking myself,  _what is next?_ I figured it will be nice to create visualisations that allow users to interact with the algorithm's results. 

The result is [an interactive graph](https://textgraph-app.herokuapp.com/) visualising the similarities between Hollywood movies. The similarities between movies are determined by mapping each movie summary to a tf-idf vector. 

Source code and underlying dataset can be found in my [github repo](https://github.com/rouenlee29/text-graph).
